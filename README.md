# Project 7: Webpage Showing Google Calendar Busy Times #
### Author: Shohei Etzel, sse@uoregon.edu ###

### Summary ###
Takes a user's Google Calendars and lists all events that occur (even partially) between 9am and 5pm (these "working hours" times are currently hardcoded). Each calendar's events are listed under its calendar's name.

### Features ###
Type in your preferred date range. All corresponding events during that range will occur, giving you all the times you are busy between "working hours".

### Running ###
Go to folder you want to download on the command line.

Type 'git clone https://github.com/shoheietzel/proj7-Gcal' to download

To start the server, go to the main repository and type commands 'make install' (for first time users) and then 'make run' into the terminal. To stop the server, type Ctrl + c.
